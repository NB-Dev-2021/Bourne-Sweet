        <p> <strong>Bourne</strong>  was established in Brooklyn, NY on November 23rd, 2019. We specialize in baking wholesome traditional American desserts, using only the freshest, sustainable ingredients, predominantly sourcing locally, from farms in the Hudson Valley, Catskills, Vermont, New Jersey, and in strides, seasonally, with all baking done in small batches on-site, everyday. No shortening. No preservatives. Our milk is from grass fed cows. Our espresso bars serve organic teas and Non-GMO illy caffe. Each LCB store is a green architectural design and we're active in supporting local community groups, and sustainable development initiatives at the local, national and international level.
        Favorites include the "Brooklyn Blackout Cake", hailed by Food & Wine as the "Best Chocolate Cake in America"; LCB's homage to our beloved Old Little Italy is the "Mott Street" cupcake, our take on tiramisu, a vanilla bean cupcake soaked in Illy espresso and topped with homemade mascarpone frosting; and the "Blue Velvet Cake", a moist buttermilk cake made with blueberries from farms in New Jersey, homemade cream cheese frosting and a dash of organic food coloring that is made from flowers.
